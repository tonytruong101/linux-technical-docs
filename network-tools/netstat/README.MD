## Technical Overview

Netstat (short for "network statistics") is a command-line utility that is used to display information about the network connections of a system. It is commonly used for tasks such as identifying the active network connections of a system, analyzing the traffic on the network, and troubleshooting connectivity problems.

**Here is a technical overview of how Netstat works**:

1. Netstat reads the network statistics of the operating system and retrieves information about the network connections of the system. The network statistics include data such as the protocol, the local and remote IP addresses, the local and remote port numbers, and the state of the connection.

1. Netstat displays the network statistics in a tabular form. By default, Netstat displays the protocol, the local and remote IP addresses, and the local and remote port numbers of each active network connection.

1. Netstat provides a number of options that can be used to modify the information that is displayed, such as -a (display all active network connections), -r (display the routing table), and -i (display the network interfaces).

Here is a simple example of a Netstat command that displays the active network connections:

```
netstat -a
```
This command displays the active network connections, including the protocol, the local and remote IP addresses, and the local and remote port numbers.

For more information about Netstat, you can refer to the official Netstat documentation or the documentation for your specific Netstat implementation. You can also find a wide range of resources online, including tutorials, examples, and reference materials.
