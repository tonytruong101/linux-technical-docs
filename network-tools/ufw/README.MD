## Technical Overview

UFW (short for "Uncomplicated Firewall") is a command-line utility that is used to manage the firewall of a system running the Ubuntu operating system. It is designed to be easy to use and provide a simple interface for configuring the firewall.

**Here is a technical overview of how UFW works**:

1. UFW reads the firewall rules of the system and manages the firewall based on the rules. The firewall rules specify which incoming and outgoing network traffic is allowed or denied.

1. UFW provides a number of commands that can be used to manage the firewall, such as enable (enable the firewall), disable (disable the firewall), and default (set the default firewall policy). UFW also provides commands for adding and deleting specific firewall rules, such as allow (allow incoming or outgoing traffic) and deny (deny incoming or outgoing traffic).

1. UFW automatically updates the firewall rules based on the commands that are issued. It also provides a logging feature that can be used to track the network traffic that is allowed or denied by the firewall.

## UFW Options & What do they do

list of some common options that can be used with ufw:

- **enable**: Enable the firewall.
- **disable**: Disable the firewall.
- **allow**: Allow incoming connections.
- **deny**: Deny incoming connections.
- **default**: Set the default policy for incoming connections.
- **status**: Display the status of the firewall.
- **logging**: Enable or disable logging.
- **reset**: Reset the firewall to the default settings.

**Simple example of a UFW command that enables the firewall and sets the default policy to deny incoming traffic**:

```
ufw enable
ufw default deny incoming
```
This command enables the firewall and sets the default policy to deny incoming traffic, which means that all incoming traffic will be denied unless explicitly allowed by a specific firewall rule.

## Other Example Use Cases of AWK

**Allow incoming connections on a specific port:**

```
ufw allow 22/tcp
```
This will allow incoming connections on port 22 (SSH). The /tcp specifies that the rule applies to TCP traffic.

**Deny incoming connections on a specific port:**

```
ufw deny 80/tcp
```
This will deny incoming connections on port 80 (HTTP). The /tcp specifies that the rule applies to TCP traffic.

**Allow incoming connections from a specific IP address:**

```
ufw allow from 1.2.3.4
```
This will allow incoming connections from the IP address 1.2.3.4.


**Allow incoming connections from a specific IP address range:**

```
ufw allow from 1.2.3.0/24
```
This will allow incoming connections from the IP address range 1.2.3.0 to 1.2.3.255. The /24 specifies a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, which represents a range of 256 IP addresses.
