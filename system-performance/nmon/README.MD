## Technical Overview

Nmon (short for "Nigel's performance Monitor") is a command-line utility that is used to display real-time information about the resource usage of processes and the system as a whole. It is commonly used for tasks such as identifying the most resource-intensive processes, analyzing the resource usage of processes over time, and monitoring the overall performance of the system.

**Here is a technical overview of how Nmon works**:

1. Nmon reads the process table and various system statistics of the operating system and retrieves information about the processes running on the system and the resource usage of the system. The process table is a data structure that contains information about each process, such as the process ID, the command name, the status, and the resource usage.

1. Nmon displays the information about the processes and the system in a scrolling, real-time view. By default, Nmon displays the process ID, command name, and resource usage of each process, along with summary information about the system, such as the CPU utilization, the memory usage, and the network traffic.

1. Nmon provides a number of interactive commands that can be used to control the display and sort the processes, such as k (kill a process), r (renice a process), and u (display processes belonging to a specific user). Nmon also supports logging the resource usage data to a file, which can be used for later analysis and comparison.

Here is a simple example of a Nmon command that displays the real-time information about the processes on the system:

```
nmon
```
This command displays the real-time information about the processes on the system, along with summary information about the system.

For more information about Nmon, you can refer to the official Nmon documentation or the documentation for your specific Nmon implementation. You can also find a wide range of resources online, including tutorials, examples, and reference materials.
