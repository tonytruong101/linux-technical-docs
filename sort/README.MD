## Technical Overview

Sort is a command-line utility that is used to sort lines of text alphabetically or numerically. It is commonly used for tasks such as alphabetizing lists, finding the largest or smallest values in a dataset, and merging multiple files into a single, sorted file.

**Here is a technical overview of how Sort works**:

1. Sort reads input from one or more files or standard input (stdin). The input is divided into lines, which are typically separated by a newline character.

1. Sort processes the input lines and sorts them according to the specified criteria. By default, Sort sorts the lines alphabetically in ascending order.

1. Sort provides a number of options that can be used to modify its behavior, such as -n (sort numerically), -r (reverse the sort order), -t (use a custom field separator), and -k (sort by a specific field).

1. After sorting the input lines, Sort prints the output to standard output (stdout) or writes it to a file.

Here is a simple example of a Sort command that sorts a file alphabetically:

```
sort input.txt
```

This command sorts the lines in the input file alphabetically in ascending order and prints the sorted lines to stdout.

For more information about Sort, you can refer to the official Sort documentation or the documentation for your specific Sort implementation. You can also find a wide range of resources online, including tutorials, examples, and reference materials.
