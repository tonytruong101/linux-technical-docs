## Technical Overview

Uniq is a command-line tool that is used to remove duplicate lines from a file or stream of text. It is commonly used for tasks such as deduplicating lists, counting the number of unique lines in a file, and comparing files for differences.

**Here is a technical overview of how Uniq works**:

1. Uniq reads input from one or more files or standard input (stdin). The input is divided into lines, which are typically separated by a newline character.

1. Uniq processes the input lines and compares adjacent lines to identify duplicates. By default, Uniq considers two lines to be duplicates if they are identical.

1. Uniq provides a number of options that can be used to modify its behavior, such as -c (count the number of occurrences of each line), -d (only print duplicate lines), -u (only print unique lines), and -i (ignore case).

After processing the input lines, Uniq prints the output to standard output (stdout) or writes it to a file.

Here is a simple example of a Uniq command that removes duplicate lines from a file:

```
This command reads the input file and removes any lines that are identical to a preceding line. The resulting output consists of only unique lines.

For more information about Uniq, you can refer to the official Uniq documentation or the documentation for your specific Uniq implementation. You can also find a wide range of resources online, including tutorials, examples, and reference materials.
