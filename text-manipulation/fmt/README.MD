## Technical Overview

Fmt is a command-line utility that is used to reformat and justify text. It is commonly used for tasks such as formatting text files, creating tables, and formatting text for printing.

**Here is a technical overview of how Fmt works**:

1. Fmt reads input from one or more files or standard input (stdin). The input is divided into lines, which are typically separated by a newline character.

1. Fmt processes each line of input and reformats it according to the specified options. By default, Fmt adjusts the line breaks and word wraps the text to fit within a specified line width, such as 75 or 80 characters.

1. Fmt provides a number of options that can be used to modify its behavior, such as -w (set the line width), -s (squeeze multiple adjacent blank lines into a single blank line), and -u (do not break lines at spaces).

After reformatting the input lines, Fmt prints the output to standard output (stdout) or writes it to a file.

Here is a simple example of a Fmt command that reformats a file to fit within a 75-character line width:

```
fmt -w 75 input.txt
```

This command reads the input file and reformats the lines to fit within a 75-character line width.

For more information about Fmt, you can refer to the official Fmt documentation or the documentation for your specific Fmt implementation. You can also find a wide range of resources online, including tutorials, examples, and reference materials.
