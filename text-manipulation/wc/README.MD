## Technical Overview
Wc is a command-line utility that is used to count the number of lines, words, and characters in a file or stream of text. It is commonly used for tasks such as counting the number of words in a document, finding the length of a file, and analyzing text data.

**Here is a technical overview of how Wc works**:

1. Wc reads input from one or more files or standard input (stdin). The input is divided into lines, which are typically separated by a newline character.

1. Wc processes each line of input and counts the number of lines, words, and characters. A word is typically defined as a sequence of non-whitespace characters.

1. Wc provides a number of options that can be used to modify its behavior, such as -l (count the number of lines), -w (count the number of words), and -m (count the number of characters).

After counting the input, Wc prints the results to standard output (stdout). By default, Wc prints the number of lines, words, and characters.

Here is a simple example of a Wc command that counts the number of lines in a file:

```
wc -l input.txt
```
This command reads the input file and counts the number of lines. The resulting output consists of a single number that represents the total number of lines in the file.

For more information about Wc, you can refer to the official Wc documentation or the documentation for your specific Wc implementation. You can also find a wide range of resources online, including tutorials, examples, and reference materials.
