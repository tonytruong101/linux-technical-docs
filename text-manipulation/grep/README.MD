## Technical Overview

Grep is a command-line tool that is used for searching and filtering text. It is commonly used for tasks such as searching for specific patterns in a file or stream, extracting lines that match a particular criterion, and counting the number of occurrences of a pattern.

**Here is a technical overview of how Grep works**:

1. Grep reads input from one or more files or standard input (stdin). The input is divided into lines, which are typically separated by a newline character.

1. Grep processes each line of input and compares it to a search pattern, which is specified using a regular expression. A regular expression is a set of characters and special symbols that define a pattern that can be matched against the input.

1. If the input line matches the search pattern, Grep prints the line to standard output (stdout) or writes it to a file. If the input line does not match the search pattern, it is ignored.

1. Grep provides a number of options that can be used to modify its behavior, such as -v (invert the match), -c (count the number of matches), -i (ignore case), and -w (match whole words).

Here is a simple example of a Grep command that searches for a specific pattern in a file and prints the matching lines:

```
grep pattern input.txt
```

This command searches for lines that contain the word "pattern" in the input file and prints the entire line.

For more information about Grep, you can refer to the official Grep documentation or the documentation for your specific Grep implementation. You can also find a wide range of resources online, including tutorials, examples, and reference materials.
