## Technical Overview

Cut is a command-line tool that is used to extract specific fields or columns from a file or stream of text. It is commonly used for tasks such as selecting specific data from a tabular data file, extracting specific parts of a file, and reformatting text data.

**Here is a technical overview of how Cut works**:

1. Cut reads input from one or more files or standard input (stdin). The input is divided into lines, which are typically separated by a newline character.

1. Cut processes each line of input and extracts the specified fields or columns. Fields are typically separated by a field separator, which can be a space, a tab, or a custom delimiter.

1. Cut provides a number of options that can be used to specify the fields or columns to extract, such as -f (specify a list of fields), -c (specify a list of character positions), and -d (specify a custom field separator).

1. After extracting the specified fields or columns, Cut prints the output to standard output (stdout) or writes it to a file.

Here is a simple example of a Cut command that extracts the second and third fields from a file:

```
cut -f 2,3 input.txt
```

This command extracts the second and third fields from each line in the input file
