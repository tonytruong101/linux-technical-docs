## Technical Overview

Strace is a command-line utility that is used to trace the system calls and signals of a program. It is commonly used for tasks such as debugging, performance analysis, and security auditing.

**Here is a technical overview of how Strace works**:

1. Strace runs a program and intercepts the system calls and signals that the program makes.

1. Strace logs the intercepted system calls and signals to standard output (stdout) or to a file. By default, Strace logs the name of the system call, the arguments passed to the system call, and the return value of the system call.

1. Strace provides a number of options that can be used to modify its behavior, such as -f (trace child processes), -p (attach to a running process), and -e (trace specific system calls or signals).

Here is a simple example of a Strace command that traces a program:

```
strace program
```

This command runs the program and logs all of the system calls and signals that the program makes to stdout.

For more information about Strace, you can refer to the official Strace documentation or the documentation for your specific Strace implementation. You can also find a wide range of resources online, including tutorials, examples, and reference materials.
