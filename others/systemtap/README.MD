## Technical Overview

SystemTap is a dynamic tracing tool that is used to monitor the behavior of programs and the operating system. It is commonly used for tasks such as performance analysis, debugging, and security auditing.

**Here is a technical overview of how SystemTap works**:

1. SystemTap runs a set of probes, which are special functions that are inserted into the code of a program or the operating system. The probes are activated when specific events or conditions occur, such as a system call being made or a specific line of code being executed.

1. When a probe is activated, SystemTap logs the data associated with the probe to standard output (stdout) or to a file. The logged data can include information such as the arguments passed to a system call, the return value of a function, or the value of a variable.

1. SystemTap provides a scripting language that can be used to define the probes and the actions to take when the probes are activated. The SystemTap script can include conditions, aggregations, and transformations to process and analyze the data collected by the probes.

1. SystemTap also provides a number of built-in functions and variables that can be used to manipulate the data collected by the probes.

Here is a simple example of a SystemTap command that traces the system calls made by a program:

```
stap -e 'probe syscall.%{NAME} { log(execname) }'
```
This command runs SystemTap and activates a probe on every system call
