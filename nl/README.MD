## Technical Overview

Nl is a command-line utility that is used to number the lines of a file or stream of text. It is commonly used for tasks such as creating numbered lists, adding line numbers to source code, and generating line numbering for documents.

**Here is a technical overview of how Nl works**:

1. Nl reads input from one or more files or standard input (stdin). The input is divided into lines, which are typically separated by a newline character.

1. Nl processes each line of input and adds a line number to the beginning of the line. By default, Nl starts numbering at line 1 and increments the line number by 1 for each line.

1. Nl provides a number of options that can be used to modify its behavior, such as -b (specify the numbering format), -n (set the starting line number and increment), and -w (set the number width).

After adding line numbers to the input lines, Nl prints the output to standard output (stdout) or writes it to a file.

Here is a simple example of a Nl command that numbers the lines of a file:

```
nl input.txt
```
This command reads the input file and adds line numbers to the beginning of each line. The resulting output consists of numbered lines.

For more information about Nl, you can refer to the official Nl documentation or the documentation for your specific Nl implementation. You can also find a wide range of resources online, including tutorials, examples, and reference materials.
