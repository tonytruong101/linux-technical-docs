## What type of top to use

top, htop, and atop are all command-line utilities that are used to display real-time information about the processes running on a system. They are commonly used for tasks such as identifying the most resource-intensive processes, analyzing the resource usage of processes, and monitoring the overall performance of the system.

**Here are some general guidelines for when to use top, htop, and atop**:

1. top is a basic utility that provides a simple, text-based interface for displaying the real-time information about the processes on the system. It is a good choice if you need a quick and simple way to monitor the processes on the system and don't need a lot of advanced features.

1. htop is similar to top, but it provides a more user-friendly interface and additional features such as a vertical and horizontal layout, process tree view, and support for mouse interactions. It is a good choice if you need a more interactive and visually appealing way to monitor the processes on the system.

1. atop is a more advanced utility that provides a detailed view of the resource usage of processes and the system as a whole. It is a good choice if you need to monitor the resource usage of the system over time and analyze the performance of the system in depth.

In general, top is a good starting point for basic process monitoring, and htop is a good choice for a more interactive and visually appealing interface. If you need to perform more advanced analysis of the resource usage of the system, atop is a good option.
