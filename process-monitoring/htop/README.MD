## Technical Overview

Htop is a command-line utility that is used to display real-time information about the processes running on a system. It is similar to the top utility, but it provides a more user-friendly interface and additional features such as a vertical and horizontal layout, process tree view, and support for mouse interactions.

**Here is a technical overview of how Htop works**:

1. Htop reads the process table of the operating system and retrieves information about the processes running on the system. The process table is a data structure that contains information about each process, such as the process ID, the command name, the status, and the resource usage.

1. Htop displays the information about the processes in a scrolling, real-time view. By default, Htop displays the process ID, command name, and resource usage of each process, along with summary information about the system, such as the total number of processes, the load average, and the uptime.

1. Htop provides a number of interactive commands that can be used to control the display and sort the processes, such as k (kill a process), r (renice a process), and u (display processes belonging to a specific user). Htop also supports mouse interactions, such as clicking on a process to kill it or using the scroll wheel to navigate the list of processes.

Here is a simple example of an Htop command that displays the real-time information about the processes on the system:

```
htop
```
This command displays the real-time information about the processes on the system, along with summary information about the system.

For more information about Htop, you can refer to the official Htop documentation or the documentation for your specific Htop implementation. You can also find a wide range of resources online, including tutorials, examples, and reference materials.
