Detailed technical overviews of linux commands

Based off of the roadmap/devops 2022 guide

## Who is this for?

If you've found your way to this github repo of mine, I've created this as a personal reference based off the roadmap skills list. This repository will be espicially useful for individuals that:

- Never touched a single command in Linux before.
- Advanced Users who've been using it for a while

Each Linux command is broken down into different types, organized further into their own directories. In each command subdirectory you will find README.MD files that include the following:

- Technical Overview Of the Command
- Commonly Used Options or Flags that are used with the Command
- Basic & Advanced Use Case Examples
